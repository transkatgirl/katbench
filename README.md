# katbench
what i use to compare LLM base models

## setup

you will need:

- a working [TGI server](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index)
- lighteval w/ TGI and math support
	- note: due to a [bug in lighteval](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval/pull/502), you will need to install the transkatgirl/lighteval fork

## usage

TODO

- note: due to a bug in lighteval, results produced by the scripts in this repo cannot be directly compared with those generated by other benchmarking tools
